The project consists of two files: the implementation file simulate.fs and an 
executable test file testSimulate.fsx which uses the fs-file's code as a module.

How to run:

Place the two files in the same folder, locate the folder in the terminal
then write the command "dotnet fsi testSimulate.fsx". The terminal
will print the test suite's results.
